# Weltab

## About it
**Weltab** - A new tab page I developed for myself using *SolidJS*.
I included most of websites that I use every day.

## How to use
The easiest way to use it it to set **https://weltab.vercel.app/** as your **Homepage**.
If you would like to use it as your *new page* every time - try to use **Custom New Tab Page**:
- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-new-tab-page/iimeokggigfllnihhakjkaeccbcijibe)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/custom-new-tab/onagfgjlokaciajhjmajljcfanonbmia)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/)

## Development
```bash
# Clone repository
